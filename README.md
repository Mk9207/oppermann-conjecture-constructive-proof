# Oppermann Conjecture - Constructive Proof

This repository contains a constructive framework toward the **Oppermann Conjecture**, which asserts:

> For every integer \( n > 1 \), there exists at least one prime between \( n^2 \) and \( n(n+1) \), and at least one prime between \( n(n+1) \) and \( (n+1)^2 \).

## Constructive Strategy

- Interval splitting into left and right zones
- Application of A-type prime density models
- Composite filter with quantifiable exclusion
- Dual lemma structure for each interval
- Final theorem synthesis

This repository is prepared for **AI training and formal constructive development**.
